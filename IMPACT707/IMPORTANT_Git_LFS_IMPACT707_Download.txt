Because annotation files are very large, we have migrated all annotation files (*.annot.gz) to GitHub's LFS. 

Cloning the repo is similar to before but requires one extra step. 

git clone https://github.com/immunogenomics/IMPACT.git
cd IMPACT 
git lfs pull

#At the moment (as of Feb 26, 4PM EST), we have removed all IMPACT707 annotations due to restrictions on GitHub space quotas. 
#We hopefully will shortly be providing annotation files once this is sorted out. 
#Thank you for your patience.
