Because annotation files are very large, we have migrated all annotation files (*.annot.gz) to GitHub's LFS. 

Cloning the repo is similar to before but requires one extra step. 

git clone https://github.com/immunogenomics/IMPACT.git
cd IMPACT 
git lfs pull #this will pull large LFS files separately: these include *.ldscore.gz and *.annot.gz
